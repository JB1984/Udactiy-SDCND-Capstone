# Udactiy-SDCND-Capstone

This repository simply contains the three python files that you need to edit to get the Capstone project working. 
It is based on the walkthroughs in the class, so the traffic light detector node just uses the information fed in
from the simulator...Neural Network for the real car is not setup yet.
